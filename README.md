# Setup guide

## Setup WP Engine install

No need to use any template here. Just create a blank install with your desired install name.

## Setup repository

### Create a repository using this template

After you have recieved confirmation from WP Engine that your install has finished setting up, create a new repo using this template.

### ⚠️ Setting repository name

It is important that your repository name matches your WP Engine install name, as it will be used for directly establishing a connection with the install using the wp-engine workflow.

## After initializing repository

### ⌛ Wait before cloning!

There is a helper action working to add some aditional files to the repository. **Give this a minute to finish.** You should see a new commit from @designcontainer-bot when the workflow has finished.
